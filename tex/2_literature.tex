\chapter{Literature Survey}

In this section, we explore various existing blockchain solutions related to judicial and government record management. Our goal is to understand what has already been achieved, where these systems succeed, and importantly, where they fall short. This helps us identify the gaps that our work can address.

To sum up, while the literature clearly highlights blockchain’s ability to bring transparency, security, and trust to governmental and judicial records, many solutions are still theoretical or narrowly focused. Real-world, scalable applications that cover the full spectrum of legal and government data management are still needed, and that is where our work aims to contribute.
