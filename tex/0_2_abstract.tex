Ensuring the security, integrity, and accessibility of government legal records is a major challenge. Traditional centralized databases are prone to cyberattacks, data manipulation, and other issues, which can compromise sensitive legal documents and potentially slow down judicial processes. Blockchain technology provides a robust solution for enhancing record security and law enforcement procedures. Our project hopes to develop a blockchain framework for government legal records, while also analyzing blockchain’s role in law enforcement, exploring smart contracts for automating legal documentation, and assessing implementation challenges. Blockchains such as Hyperledger, are more suitable for government applications due to controlled access and enhanced security. The project focuses on legal records, law enforcement documentation, and judicial data, emphasizing a Hyperledger-based approach over cryptocurrency-based models. Expected outcomes include a tamper-proof blockchain model, improved efficiency in law enforcement, and identification of legal and technical challenges for successful implementation.
